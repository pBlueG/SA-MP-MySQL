R35
- code cleanup and improvements
- fixed bug where mysql_escape_string didn't set the dest. var. to empty if the source var. was empty
- removed duplicate connection check; you can now create multiple connections to the same database
- fixed bug where the HTML logging logged every callback even if there wasn't any error/warning/debug message in it
- added native "mysql_current_handle", take a look at the wiki for more informations (http://wiki.sa-mp.com/wiki/MySQL/R33)

R34
- fixed bug where orm_update generated wrong queries
- fixed bug where queries sometimes lost connection to a remote database
- added natives "orm_load" and "orm_save" for even easier data management
- added additional (optional) parameter "use_cache" for native "mysql_query" to determine if the cache will be used or not
- added native "mysql_unprocessed_queries" to retrieve the amount of unprocessed queries
- improved backward compatibility a bit

R33
- added ORM system
- improved Windows XP compatibility (proven to work now)
- added parameter values to debug native log messages
- improved y_inline compatiblity code
- "orm_select" and "orm_insert" support y_inline (use "orm_select_inline" and "orm_insert_inline")
- added Cache-tags to cache_set_active, cache_save and cache_delete
- added natives "cache_get_row_count" and "cache_get_field_count"
- added more safety checks
- speed improvements
- fixed bug where mysql_free_result wasn't called internally if callback processing was skipped
- improved thread safety
- improved HTML-logging, reduced file size
- code cleanup
- rewrote the whole (multi-)threading system, multi-threading works now only per-connection (every connection has their own thread)
- added native "mysql_query" for unthreaded queries
- native "mysql_reconnect" no longer returns true if connection was successful and false if not, use "mysql_errno" instead
- improved makefile, use "make" to create a dynamic and static version, "make dynamic" and "make static" are self-explaining

R31
- added empty string checks to datatype conversion
- changed some details in the log system
- limited threads to 6

R30
- changed datatype conversion again (method in R29 was slow and still bugging)
- fixed some log messages
- fixed crash when unloading the plugin
- code improvements

R29
- fixed wrong function name logging in mysql_escape_string
- changed datatype conversion, it is now independent of the field data type
- fixed bug where automatic reconnect is always disabled

R28
- code improvements
- added more string checks
- added '%%' specifier to native 'mysql_format'
- fixed thread logic mistake
- fixed bug where saving and deleting the active result in the same callback would crash the server
- fixed bug where HTML log variables weren't initialized properly
- fixed bug where sending a query after a reconnect the old MySQL handle was used
- improved thread safety
- edited threading design: plugin uses one thread fewer; connections to the MySQL server are now established/closed in real-time
- mysql_reconnect returns true if connection is established, else false
- added optional parameter "autoreconnect" to mysql_connect to control whether the plugin should reconnect automatically if connection is lost
- added optional parameter "wait" to mysql_close to control whether the plugin should wait till all pending queries are executed or not
- code improvements
- re-added our old and beloved native mysql_errno
- fixed buffer overflow in logging system

R27
- added support for y_inline
- fixed some memory leaks
- improved Windows XP compatibility
- fixed bug where OnQueryError parameters had empty values
- renamed mysql_real_escape_string to mysql_escape_string
- rewrote native mysql_format
- reduced usage of memory allocation (malloc)
- added enum datatype support to int-conversion natives
- replaced mysql_function_query native wrapper with pawn define
- changed MySQL connector again (sorry for that, Windows users will have to update the libmysql.dll again)
- improved HTML log file design

R26
- removed native mysql_mt
- multi-threading activates automatically depending on number of CPU cores
- increased overall performance (2x faster on Linux!)
- updated MySQL connector
- added a new log system: visual .html log file, which is also much much faster than old system (90 times faster on my machine!)
- added new parameter to mysql_log: logtype (LOG_TYPE_TEXT (default) or LOG_TYPE_HTML)
- plugin should now be compatible on all machines running Windows XP

R25
- fixed unreferenced symbol error on Linux
- fixed bug when calling mysql_mt(false) the multithreading system gets initialized anyway (but not used)
- fixed crash on Linux

R24:
- fixed bug where the mysql_function_query wrapper crashed
- fixed bug where multithreading was still initiated even when not activated with 'mysql_mt'
- fixed makefile's
- increased performance of all _int and _float functions

R23:
- added natives cache_affected_rows, cache_insert_id and cache_warning_count
- re-added mysql_function_query (cache parameter is ignored by the plugin, cache always enabled)
- fixed crash in mysql_real_escape_string
- improved performance of all _int and _float functions

R21:
- code overhaul, this plugin is now cache-only
- increased performance
- removed all mysql_fetch natives and replaced them with cache-wrappers
- fixed bug where active cache gets deleted even if it is stored when calling 'cache_set_active'
- improved mutex performance on Windows
- mutex now again enabled by default (on Windows AND Linux)
- if calling 'cache_set_active(0)', active cache will be cleared (, so there is no active cache anymore, but the cache won't be deleted if it was stored before)
- removed natives 'mysql_debug', 'mysql_errno', 'mysql_warning_count', 'mysql_ping'
- renamed native 'mysql_function_query' to 'mysql_tquery' and removed cache parameter
- added multithreading, disabled by default, enable by calling 'mysql_mt(true)'
  WARNING: Multithreading can be slower than normal threading on computers with bad CPU's, make sure you have at least 2 cores!
- when calling mysql_close, the connection will only be closed when all pending queries are executed
- when sending queries in OnGameModeExit and shutting down the server, the plugin (and therefore the server) will only close when all pending queries are executed


R20:
- fixed bug with mysql_fetch_field freeing wrong memory
- fixed evil bug with mysql_data_seek getting a wrong connection handle which led to a dead lock
- fixed many possible mutex errors/deadlocks (especially when providing a invalid connection handle)
- fixed bug where using 'LOG_NONE' in mysql_log would be ignored
- renamed 'cache_store' to 'cache_save' due to confusion
- renamed 'cache_free' to 'cache_delete' due to confusion
- fixed several bugs with mysql_format (string precision, %s and %e specifiers were ignored if value was empty, wrong memory allocation when used decimal precision)
- added parameter 'len' to mysql_format after parameter 'output' to avoid memory overwriting (mysql_format(SQL, dest, sizeof(dest), "SELECT...); instead of mysql_format(SQL, dest, "SELECT...);)


R18:
- renamed 'cache_get_field_int' to 'cache_get_field_content_int'
- renamed 'cache_get_field_float' to 'cache_get_field_content_float'
- fixed bug where converting a value with an other datatype than 'int' in the function 'cache_get_field_content_int' resulted in a crash (same thing with float-function)
- fixed bug where converting a value with an other datatype than 'int' in the function 'cache_get_row_int' resulted in a crash (same thing with float-function)
- fixed bug with invalid file pointer
- fixed bug when opening 2 connections and closing the first one, the second one will be invalid and will become the first one.
- connections will now only be detected as duplicate if the connection data is exactly the same as the duplicate's one (wasn't the case before)
- fixed crash when providing an invalid index to 'cache_get_row'
- the mutex method is now enabled by default on Windows only (you can still disable it with 'enable_mutex(false)')
- added functions 'cache_store', 'cache_free' and 'cache_set_active':
  - use 'cache_store()' to store the active cache. 'cache_store' returns an id which can be used in 'cache_free' and 'cache_set_active'.
  - use 'cache_free(id)' to release the memory of the stored cache. The stored memory gets released anyway when closing the mysql connection.
  - use 'cache_set_active(id)' to set the stored cache to the active one. When the cache is in the active-state, all normal cache functions can be used. The cache will stay as active until a cache-enabled query will be sent and the public called. Then the active cache is the normal cache.
- added function 'mysql_log':
  this function replaces 'mysql_debug' (alltough it's still available for backwards compability). Now you can control which things get logged, i.e. you can call 'mysql_log(LOG_ERROR | LOG_DEBUG)' to log only errors and debug informations. The default log setting is 'LOG_ERROR | LOG_WARNING', thus will log only errors and warnings. Available log types are 'LOG_ERROR', 'LOG_WARNING', 'LOG_DEBUG' and 'LOG_NONE'.
- added prefixes to log lines which indicate if that log is an error, warning or debug information (i.e. '[14:32:29] [ERROR] CMySQLHandler...' instead of '[14:32:29] CMySQLHandler...')
- fixed bug with mutex deadlock on Linux
- fixed bug: not calling mysql_store and _free will cause the a 'commands out of sync' error when mysql_ping gets called in the internal mysql-thread. (alltough have no clue how I fixed that and how that bug happened)
- when a query-error occured in the internal mysql-thread, the error will now be printed in the mysql-log AND forwarded to the error-callback (the error was only forwarded to the callback before)
