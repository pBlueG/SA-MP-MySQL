MySQL Plugin for San Andreas Multiplayer (SA:MP)
------------------------------------------------
*The best and most famous MySQL plugin for SA:MP out there!*

**This plugin allows you to use MySQL in PAWN. It's currently being developed by maddinat0r.**

How to install
--------------
Move *mysql.dll* (Windows) or *mysql.so* (Linux) to your `plugins/` directory. If you are on Windows you also have to move the *libmysql.dll* to your main server directory.
You'll have to edit the server configuration (*server.cfg*) as follows:
#### Windows
<pre>plugins mysql</pre>

#### Linux
<pre>plugins mysql.so</pre>


mysql.so is library for MySQL version 5.1 and that version is the minimum supported version on all Linux distributions. The libmysqlclient18 is for version 5.5 and there is also a precompiled plugin binary for that: mysql_5.5.so


Compiling notes
---------------
#### Windows
You'll need Microsoft Visual C++ and the boost libraries to compile the plugin. Open the project file, adjust the include and library paths (for the boost library), select *Release* at the top and compile the project solution.

#### Linux
You'll need *g++-multilib*, *mysql-client* and the *boost* libraries. Once you have all the required libraries, navigate to the project's folder and type `make`.
