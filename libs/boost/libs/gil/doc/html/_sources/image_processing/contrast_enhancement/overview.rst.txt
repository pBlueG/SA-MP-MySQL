Overview
========

Contrast Enhancement is a significant part of image processing algorithms. Too dark or too
light images don't look good to the human eyes. Hence while the primary focus of these 
algorithms is to enhance visual beauty, some applications of this in medical research is also
prevalent.

We have a few contrast enhancement algorithms in the GIL image processing suite as well.
These include :
    #. :ref:`he`
    #. :ref:`hm`
    #. :ref:`ahe` 
    #. Linear and Non-Linear Contrast stretching
