# Boost.GIL Examples

This directory contains

- examples of C++ programs using GIL
- a documentation file describing the synopsis, build and execution requirements for each example
- configuration files for Boost.Build command line and CMake integration for popular IDEs.

We provide Boost.Build (`Jamfile`) and CMake (`CMakeLists.txt`)
configurations to build the examples.
See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
for details on how to run `b2` and `cmake` for Boost.GIL.

Each example is built as a separate executable.
