[section:introduction Introduction]

Boost.process V2 is an redesign of boost.process, based on previous 
design mistakes & improved system APIs.

The major changes are

* Simplified interface
* Reliance on pidfd_open on linux
* Full asio integration
* Removed unreliable functionality
* UTF8 Support
* separate compilation
* fd safe by default

[section:simplified Simplified Interface]

In process v1 one can define partial settings in the constructor of the process, 
which has lead to a small DSL.

 child c{exe="test", args+="--help", std_in < null(), env["FOO"] += "BAR"};

While this looks fancy at first, it really does not scale well with more parameters.
For process v2, the interfaces is simple: 

 extern std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> my_env;
 extern asio::io_context ctx;
 process proc(ctx, "./test", {"--help"}, process_io{nullptr, {}, {}}, process_environment(my_env));

Every initializer addresses one logical component (e.g. stdio) instead of multiple ones accumulating.
Furthermore, every process has a path and arguments, instead of a confusing mixture of cmd-style and 
exe-args that can be randomly spread out.

[section:pidfd_open pidfd_open]

Since process v1 came out, linux has moved along and added pidfd_open which allows users to get a 
file descriptor for a process. This is much more reliable since it is not as easy to miss as a `SIGCHLD`.
FreeBSD has a similar feature with `pdfork` which is also supported, while windows has provided `HANDLE`s 
for processes all along.
Unless the OS doesn't support it, process v2 will use file descriptors and handles to implement waiting 
for processes.

[section:asio Full asio integration]

Process v1 aimed to make asio optional, but synchronous IO with subprocesses usually means one is begging 
for deadlocks.
Since asio added pipes in boost 1.78, boost process V2 is fully asio based and uses it's pipes and 
file-handles for the subprocess.

[section:unreliable Unreliable functionality]

Certain parts of boost.process were not as reliable as they should've been. 

This concerns especially the `wait_for`` and `wait_until` functions on the process.
The latter are easy to do on windows, but posix does not provide an API for this. 
Thus the wait_for used signals or fork, which was all but safe. 
Since process v2 is based on asio and thus supports cancellation, 
a wait_for can not safely be implemented with an async_wait + timeout.

[section:utf8 UTF-8]

["UTF-8 or GTFO]--Vinnie Falco

Instead of using ascii-APIs on windows, process V2 just assumes UTF-8 everywhere.

[endsect]

[section:src Separate compilation]

Boost.process v2 supports separate compilation similar to other boost libraries. 
It can be achieved by defining `BOOST_PROCESS_V2_SEPARATE_COMPILATION` and including 
`<process/v2/src.hpp>` in a single compile unit.

[section:limit_fd Fd safe by default]

While not a problem on windows (since HANDLEs get manually enabled for inheritance),
posix systems create a problem with inheriting file handles by default.

Process V2 will automatically close all non-whitelisted descriptors, 
without needing any option to enable it.
