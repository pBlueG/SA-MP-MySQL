[section:start_dir process_start_dir]

The easier initializer to use is `process_start_dir`:

```
    asio::io_context ctx;
    process ls(ctx, "/ls", {}, process_start_dir("/home"));
    ls.wait();
```

This will run `ls` in the folder `/home` instead of the current folder.

[warning If your path is relative, it may fail on posix, because the directory is changed before a call to execve.]
