== Quality of the Hash Function

Many hash functions strive to have little correlation between the input and
output values. They attempt to uniformally distribute the output values for
very similar inputs. This hash function makes no such attempt. In fact, for
integers, the result of the hash function is often just the input value. So
similar but different input values will often result in similar but different
output values. This means that it is not appropriate as a general hash
function. For example, a hash table may discard bits from the hash function
resulting in likely collisions, or might have poor collision resolution when
hash values are clustered together. In such cases this hash function will
perform poorly.

But the standard has no such requirement for the hash function, it just
requires that the hashes of two different values are unlikely to collide.
Containers or algorithms designed to work with the standard hash function will
have to be implemented to work well when the hash function's output is
correlated to its input. Since they are paying that cost a higher quality hash
function would be wasteful.

== The hash_value Customization Point

The way one customizes the standard `std::hash` function object for user
types is via a specialization. `boost::hash` chooses a different mechanism --
an overload of a free function `hash_value` in the user namespace that is
found via argument-dependent lookup.

Both approaches have their pros and cons. Specializing the function object
is stricter in that it only applies to the exact type, and not to derived
or convertible types. Defining a function, on the other hand, is easier
and more convenient, as it can be done directly in the type definition as
an `inline` `friend`.

The fact that overloads can be invoked via conversions did cause issues in
an earlier iteration of the library that defined `hash_value` for all
integral types separately, including `bool`. Especially under {cpp}03,
which doesn't have `explicit` conversion operators, some types were
convertible to `bool` to allow their being tested in e.g. `if` statements,
which caused them to hash to 0 or 1, rarely what one expects or wants.

This, however, was fixed by declaring the built-in `hash_value` overloads
to be templates constrained on e.g. `std::is_integral` or its moral
equivalent. This causes types convertible to an integral to no longer
match, avoiding the problem.

== Hash Value Stability

In general, the library does not promise that the hash values will stay
the same from release to release (otherwise improvements would be
impossible). However, historically values have been quite stable. Before
release 1.81, the previous changes have been in 1.56 (a better
`hash_combine`) and 1.78 (macOS-specific change to `hash_combine`.)

Code should generally not depend on specific hash values, but for those
willing to take the risk of occasional breaks due to hash value changes,
the library now has a test that checks hash values for a number of types
against reference values (`test/hash_reference_values.cpp`),
whose https://github.com/boostorg/container_hash/commits/develop/test/hash_reference_values.cpp[version history]
can be used as a rough guide to when hash values have changed, and for what
types.

== hash_combine

The initial implementation of the library was based on Issue 6.18 of the
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2005/n1837.pdf[Library Extension Technical Report Issues List]
(pages 63-67) which proposed the following implementation of `hash_combine`:

[source]
----
template<class T>
void hash_combine(size_t & seed, T const & v)
{
    seed ^= hash_value(v) + (seed << 6) + (seed >> 2);
}
----

taken from the paper
"https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/jzobel/fulltext/jasist03thz.pdf[Methods for Identifying Versioned and Plagiarised Documents]"
by Timothy C. Hoad and Justin Zobel.

During the Boost formal review, Dave Harris pointed out that this suffers
from the so-called "zero trap"; if `seed` is initially 0, and all the
inputs are 0 (or hash to 0), `seed` remains 0 no matter how many input
values are combined.

This is an undesirable property, because it causes containers of zeroes
to have a zero hash value regardless of their sizes.

To fix this, the arbitrary constant `0x9e3779b9` (the golden ratio in a
32 bit fixed point representation) was added to the computation, yielding

[source]
----
template<class T>
void hash_combine(size_t & seed, T const & v)
{
    seed ^= hash_value(v) + 0x9e3779b9 + (seed << 6) + (seed >> 2);
}
----

This is what shipped in Boost 1.33, the first release containing the library.

This function was a reasonable compromise between quality and speed for its
time, when the input consisted of ``char``s, but it's less suitable for
combining arbitrary `size_t` inputs.

In Boost 1.56, it was replaced by functions derived from Austin Appleby's
https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/blob/61a0530f28277f2e850bfc39600ce61d02b518de/src/MurmurHash2.cpp#L57-L62[MurmurHash2 hash function round].

In Boost 1.81, it was changed again -- to the equivalent of
`mix(seed + 0x9e3779b9 + hash_value(v))`, where `mix(x)` is a high quality
mixing function that is a bijection over the `size_t` values, of the form

[source]
----
x ^= x >> k1;
x *= m1;
x ^= x >> k2;
x *= m2;
x ^= x >> k3;
----

This type of mixing function was originally devised by Austin Appleby as
the "final mix" part of his MurmurHash3 hash function. He used

[source]
----
x ^= x >> 33;
x *= 0xff51afd7ed558ccd;
x ^= x >> 33;
x *= 0xc4ceb9fe1a85ec53;
x ^= x >> 33;
----

as the https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/blob/61a0530f28277f2e850bfc39600ce61d02b518de/src/MurmurHash2.cpp#L57-L62[64 bit function `fmix64`] and

[source]
----
x ^= x >> 16;
x *= 0x85ebca6b;
x ^= x >> 13;
x *= 0xc2b2ae35;
x ^= x >> 16;
----

as the https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/blob/61a0530f28277f2e850bfc39600ce61d02b518de/src/MurmurHash3.cpp#L68-L77[32 bit function `fmix32`].

Several improvements of the 64 bit function have been subsequently proposed,
by https://zimbry.blogspot.com/2011/09/better-bit-mixing-improving-on.html[David Stafford],
https://mostlymangling.blogspot.com/2019/12/stronger-better-morer-moremur-better.html[Pelle Evensen],
and http://jonkagstrom.com/mx3/mx3_rev2.html[Jon Maiga]. We currently use Jon
Maiga's function

[source]
----
x ^= x >> 32;
x *= 0xe9846af9b1a615d;
x ^= x >> 32;
x *= 0xe9846af9b1a615d;
x ^= x >> 28;
----

Under 32 bit, we use a mixing function proposed by "TheIronBorn" in a
https://github.com/skeeto/hash-prospector/issues/19[Github issue] in
the https://github.com/skeeto/hash-prospector[repository] of
https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/07/31/[Hash Prospector] by Chris Wellons:

[source]
----
x ^= x >> 16;
x *= 0x21f0aaad;
x ^= x >> 15;
x *= 0x735a2d97;
x ^= x >> 15;
----

With this improved `hash_combine`, `boost::hash` for strings now passes the
https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher[SMHasher test suite] by Austin Appleby
(for a 64 bit `size_t`).

== hash_range

The traditional implementation of `hash_range(seed, first, last)` has been

[source]
----
for( ; first != last; ++first )
{
    boost::hash_combine<typename std::iterator_traits<It>::value_type>( seed, *first );
}
----

(the explicit template parameter is needed to support iterators with proxy
return types such as `std::vector<bool>::iterator`.)

This is logical, consistent and straightforward. In the common case where
`typename std::iterator_traits<It>::value_type` is `char` -- which it is
in the common case of `boost::hash<std::string>` -- this however leaves a
lot of performance on the table, because processing each `char` individually
is much less efficient than processing several in bulk.

In Boost 1.81, `hash_range` was changed to process elements of type `char`,
`signed char`, `unsigned char`, `std::byte`, or `char8_t`, four of a time.
A `uint32_t` is composed from `first[0]` to `first[3]`, and that `uint32_t`
is fed to `hash_combine`.

In Boost 1.82, `hash_range` for these types was changed to use
https://github.com/pdimov/mulxp_hash[`mulxp1_hash`]. This improves both
quality and speed of string hashing.

Note that `hash_range` has also traditionally guaranteed that the same element
sequence yields the same hash value regardless of the iterator type. This
property remains valid after the changes to `char` range hashing. `hash_range`,
applied to the `char` sequence `{ 'a', 'b', 'c' }`, results in the same value
whether the sequence comes from `char[3]`, `std::string`, `std::deque<char>`,
or `std::list<char>`.
